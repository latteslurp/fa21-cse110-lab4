1. It will print 3, because `i=3` is when  `i` went out of bound of the `for` loop.
2. It will print 150, because that is the last `discountedPrice` computed from the given array.
3. It will print 150, because that is the last `finalPrice` computed from the given array.
4. It will return the array of discounted prices (`[50,100,150]`).
5. It will cause an error since i only lives within the `for` loop scope/block.
6. It will cause an error since `discountedPrices` only lives within the for loop scope/block.
7. It will print 150, because that is the last `finalPrice` computed from the given array (`finalPrice` is within the scope of the `discountPrices` function).
8. It will return the array of discounted prices (`[50,100,150]`).
9. It will cause an error since i only lives within the for loop scope/block.
10. It will print 3, because `const length` is initiated to `prices.length` in `discountPrices` function.
11. It will return the array of discounted prices (`[50,100,150]`).

16. (answer in js file)
17. `modifyArray([1,2,3], doSomething)` will gives us [2,4,6]. First we initiated an array called `newArr`. we iterate through array [1,2,3] that is passed on to the function. Within the loop, we will push the value of `array[i]` which will be multiplied by 2 by `doSomething` to `newArr`, where `i` is the index iteration of the loop. After we are done with the iteration, we return `newArr`.
